# Black-Book

This is a Multiple Choice RPG game I have been working on since 9/18/24

- Most of it is playable in Unity this repo is just to store the base code for it.
Meaning this version can only run a text version of the game-> more like a visual novel 
then a Third-person/First-person rpg(this version is also still being updated and the status of whether it works
or not will be updated here:)

** Game State: Working up till travel menu2 **

* Check out the Unity Repo to play the full version! (Third-person multiple choice rpg)
